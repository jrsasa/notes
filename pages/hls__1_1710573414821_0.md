- y to reconstruct high quality images, which greatly reduces the amount of computation and data storage required. Furthermore, the order of the Hadamard patterns can be optimized to reduce the redundancy of random measurements, further decreasing the sampling rate[16–18]. Spectral imaging can obtain 2-D spatial and one-dimensional(1-D) spectral information of an object simultaneously, and thus generate a three-dimensional (3-D) cube [19–22]. High spectral resolution is of great signiﬁcance for precise object detection. To date, conventional hyperspectral imaging can achieve resolutions of <10 nm, but it is difﬁcult to obtain both high spectral and spatial resolution at the same time [23,24]. Single-h (SPSI) provides a new way to solve this problem and systems based on spectral ﬁltering, Fourier transform and grating splitting have emerged which can realize multispectral or hyperspectral imaging [19,25–30]. However, most of these only focus on spectral resolution and do not discuss the spatial resolution parameters. In this paper, we designed a SPSI measurement system that can realize data compression and obtain good spectral and spatial resolution at the same time. The spectral bandwidth can be narrowed using data optimization, and the corresponding change in the spatial resolution is examined. The experimental results showed that, with a spectrometer of 1.2 nm spectral resolution, hyperspectral imaging could be realized with a spatial resolution of 1.11 mrad at a greatly reduced sampling rate of12.5% for a 64 × 64 pixel image. Moreover, by using compressive sensing, this method greatly reduces the amount of data that has to be stored and transmitted.2. PRINCIPLE In our SPSI measurement system, the light reﬂected from an object is modulated by a digital micromirror device (DMD), which passes through the entrance slit of a spectrometer and,1559-128X/23/102610-07 Journal © 2023 Optica Publishing Group

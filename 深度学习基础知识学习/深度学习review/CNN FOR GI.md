 The approach uses deep learning in the form of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform the reconstruction of an image based on fewer
measurements than would be required for the orthogonal sampling methods or the traditional ghost imaging techniquesã€‚

an application of CNNs developed by many groups has been to make reconstructions of an image from random patterns. this CGI using a CNN has produced equivalant results to a regularised method. 
sampling with random patterns is much less efficient deep learning allows the sampling basis itself to be constructed to be most efficient to samole a scene,

single pixel imaging does not necessarily need to perform a full image reconstruction to detect and classify objects. the technique could be extended further to enable a sensing system that feeds into a control system, sucha as an autonomous vechicle, meaning the creation of an image to analyse is not required for the 
image free classification

finally, using optical machine learning with a single pixel detector may also be a possibility for image reconstruction. a diffrwactive neural network made up of a cascade of phase-only masks can reconstruct images without requiring the processing power of a computer
